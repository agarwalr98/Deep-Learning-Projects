## Image Denoising

### Description
#### What is Image Denoising ?
Image Denoising is the process of removing or reducing the noise from the images using a Deep learning model.

#### How do we get noisy images ?
Noisy or low quality images can be obtained by adding noise(follows Normal distribution N(mean, standard deviation)) in input dataset.

#### NOTE 
This folder contains the output images and graph for low quality images obtained by introducing noise with a normal distribution of N(1,1).

### Format of resultant Image
The output of the model consists of three sections combined into one image.
The sections are - 
1. Input Images - Top section 
2. Noisy Images - Middle section
3. Generated or Output Images - Bottom section
