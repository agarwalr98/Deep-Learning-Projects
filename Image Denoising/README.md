## Image Denoising

### Description
#### What is Image Denoising ?
Image Denoising is the process of removing or reducing the noise from the images using a Deep learning model.

#### How do we get noisy images ?
Noisy or low quality images can be obtained by adding noise(follows Normal distribution N(mean, standard deviation)) in input dataset.

#### NOTE 
This folder contains the output images and graph for low quality images obtained by introducing noise with a normal distribution of N(1,1).

### Format of resultant Image
The frame of resultant images contain Input, Noisy and Generated(Output) images in following order - 
Input Images - At top 
Noisy Images - At middle 
Generated or Output Images - At Bottom
